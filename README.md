# AutomaticFloor Cleaning Robot using ROS
### Introduction
The Floor Cleaning Robot using ROS is an
innovative project that explores the integration
of robotics and automation technology into
everyday cleaning tasks. This project aims to
design and develop an autonomous robot
capable of efficiently navigating and cleaning
indoor environments, thereby revolutionizing
traditional floor cleaning methods. By
leveraging the power of the Robot Operating
System (ROS), the robot's capabilities are
enhanced, allowing seamless communication
between its various components for improved
efficiency and performance
